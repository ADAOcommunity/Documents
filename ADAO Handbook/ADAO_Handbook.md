# The ADAO Handbook

## Purpose of Handbook

The purpose of this handbook is to inform members of ADAO and the Cardano Community of the rights and responsibilities of participating in ADAO.  It is intended to be a complement to the ADAO Constitution which can be found on Github at: 
- https://github.com/ADAOcommunity/ADAO-Constitution

## Guiding Values and History

ADAO was established on November 13, 2021 with the generation of the ADAO Identity NFT: 

- https://cardanoscan.io/token/2f1ca92cbb53b23e214393fa230a25da97bbcc9e55d76e211a4deccf4144414f

Leading up to and following the minting of the Identity NFT, ADAO became a gathering place for Cardanians interested in exploring the topic of decentralized governance and the feasibility of establishing DAOs on Cardano.  Through discussions on Discord and public meetings on Twitter Spaces these individuals formed a working group that would become the Founding Core Contributors of ADAO.

As interest in the DAO grew more Cardanians were attracted to the group.  The Cardano community recognized the potential in the organization and Partnerships were formed with other builders in the network.  Community Associates turned into Active Contributors as they found ways that they could provide value to the organization.

While the Founding Core Contributors all believed in highly-distributed forms of governance, the governing script was controlled by 16 governance tokens that had been initially distributed to 8 people.  This was done out of necessity because without a convenient interface for proposal interaction the script governors had to utilize the Command Line Interface for each interaction with the underlying governance script .

By the hard work of the Development team, a governance system was developed that would be more easily accessible to all users.  At the same time the DAO created identity standards, membership management, and processes for ensuring that decentralized work could be done in an efficient manner.  Additional governance tokens were minted within the ADAO Treasury that would become available for distribution.

 ADAO Continues to strive for full decentralization through open collaboration and events like our community airdrop of governance tokens from the Treasury.  This airdrop, 1) Rewarded the Founding Core Contributors for their organizational work, 2) Rewarded Early Supporters for their contributions, 3) Funded Groundwork Bounties to incentivize specific projects, and 4) Funded a Community Faucet that would give any member of the Cardano community an opportunity to obtain tokens.
Through the process of token distribution and claiming the tokens all Founding Core Contributors and Early Supporters ratified the ADAO Constitution and adopted this Handbook for organizational structure.

## Membership

Membership in ADAO shall be granted to all members of the Cardano community who are willing to uphold the ADAO Mission Statement and ratify the Constitution. A member of the Cardano community is anyone who possesses a Cardano wallet with stake delegated to an active stake pool. There shall be no requirement to contribute time to ADAO projects or assets to the ADAO Treasury.

Members shall fall into one or more of the following categories:

1. **GovToken Holders** 

Are individuals who hold the ADAO Governance Token (ADAO). GovToken Holders are responsible for deciding the priorities of the DAO through the proposal process.  No assets may be moved out of the DAO treasury without a vote of GovToken Holders and all program coordination is formalized through votes on proposals. To obtain the GovToken Holder role it is necessary to register the wallet holding the GovTokens via HazelBot on ADAOs discord server.

2. **Active Contributors** | Discord role: **ADAO Builder**

Community volunteers who dedicate their time to DAO projects or working groups. Individuals who contribute can claim bounties from the DAO treasury and use any GovTokens they receive to vote on what projects the DAO should work on next. Working group leads will be in charge of nominating members of their working groups to become active contributors, as well as initiating the removal of the role if the member becomes inactive. Roles will be assigned by ADAO server administrators. The ADAO Builder role will be working group specific, e.g. **ADAO Builder Development**, **ADAO Builder Administration**

3. **Community Associates** | Discord role: **ADAO Supporter**

Any member of the Cardano community who chooses to associate with ADAO.  Even if an individual does not yet hold any GovTokens they can engage in legitimate peripheral participation by engaging in community discussions to help guide DAO efforts. By joining the ADAO discord server and verifying oneself the role is automatically assigned by the system.

4. **Core Contributor**

There shall also be members selected to serve on an advisory group of Core Contributors.  These advisors will be responsible for managing the administrative operations of ADAO, overseeing the social media and communication channels, and organizing meetings of ADAO members. 

Core Contributors may also be responsible for leading the Working Groups of ADAO and serve as multi-sig trustees of any Associated Contracts established by the ADAO Governing Smart Contract.  Individuals will serve in this role until their term expires, they are recalled, or they resign according to the procedures set up in the Governing Smart Contract.

5. **Working Group Lead**

## ADAO Coordination

In order to function properly ADAO shall appoint core contributors to carry out certain tasks. For a member to become a core contributor they are required to hold the active contributor role and informally voice interest in becoming a CC. To decide if a member will become a CC an official vote has to be initiated, deciding if a members becomes a CC, two existing core contributors have to support the proposal. If the proposal passes with a majority approval of 51% of all tokens in circulation the member will be assigned the core contributor role by server administrators.

Every ADAO member shall be able to initiate the removal of an existing core contributor. The only prerequisite is that their proposal is supported by two existing core contributors. If the proposal passes with a majority approval of 51% of all tokens in circulation the core contributor role will be removed from the member by server administrators.

With a deadline of two epochs before The Dozen is slated to begin, ADAO members shall submit proposals detailing how The Dozen shall be structured. Each proposal should outline:

1. What ADAO Members shall be designated as the Core Contributors
2. What working groups will be funded in The Dozen
3. The bounty to be paid out to each working group
4. The Core Contributor(s) responsible for organizing each working group
5. The end date of The Dozen (which should be 12 epochs in the future unless some special circumstance dictates otherwise).

It should also be noted:

1. Standing groups shall include Administration, Development, Community Management, Education, Governance, Treasury, Outreach, Legal, Graphic Design & Branding, and Public Relation & Marketing.
2. Ad-hoc groups may be formed as needs arise.

Voting for The Dozen proposals shall be on-chain with Gov Tokens. The voting period begins one epoch before the start of The Dozen and ends 24 hours before The Dozen is slated to  begin.  One winner will be picked according to the rules of the Primary Smart Contract and competing proposals will be discarded. While the Core Contributors will be expected to put forth a proposal for the coming Dozen, competing proposals may be submitted by any ADAO member.

The designated bounties shall be paid from the ADAO Treasury into Associated Smart Contracts immediately upon passage of a proposal. These contracts shall have trusted ADAO members designated as Bounty Judges who will control disbursement of the funds. This approach has been chosen to ensure funds can be allocated without requiring a general vote of all ADAO token holders for a basic bounty proposal. The contracts will also have an expiration date encoded, after which time any Cardano wallet can be used to send the unspent funds back to the ADAO treasury.  If any ADAO members believe that the funds were awarded unwisely by the muti-signatories they may appeal to the other members to hold them accountable when considering future bounties.

## The ADAO Foundation

The Legal working group and ADAO Core Contributors shall be responsible for appointing directors of the ADAO Foundation, a non-profit entity in Lichtenstein.  This foundation is controlled by a council of no less than three directors with a local representative to carry out their directives.

The foundation shall Hold the intellectual DAO’s interests, property rights, and enforce any such related legal rights.  To fund the foundation ADAO shall provide assets from the Treasury into a multi-signature wallet controlled by the directors.  The Legal working group and ADAO Core Contributors have the right to appoint and dismiss directors from the foundation at will.

## Standards of Conduct

ADAO was built upon a community spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.  We recognize every person as a sovereign individual who has the right to determine their own identity and path in life.  In turn, we make no demands upon each other except to allow us the right of free conduct and association.

The ADAO community will not tolerate any unprovoked acts of aggression by one individual against another.  This includes but is not limited to physical altercations, personal insults, or sustained harassment.  All individuals are entitled to express their opinions and sincerely held personal beliefs so long as they allow others the same courtesy.

In order to maintain coordination and cooperation the ADAO Core Contributors shall assign administrators and moderators to oversee communication platforms and specific rules set for use.  Failure to follow the rules of ADAO moderators may result in an account being banned or blocked.  Individuals who believe they have been banned or blocked unfairly may appeal to the moderators or Core Contributors to lift the ban, or petition the ADAO membership through a proposal.

While all members of ADAO work together to achieve the objectives of the DAO each individual is also free to work for their own purposes and express their own opinions.  The positions and policies of the DAO shall be represented through the proposal process.  Each member of ADAO, especially those in active and core positions, should make it clear that when they express themselves they are representing their own position and not that of the DAO.

## Proposal Standards

The Core Contributors shall designate Proposal Standards and the Proposal Process.  Information shall be shared in the Designated Communication Platform.

## Treasury

The treasury of ADAO holds the majority of GovTokens and is controlled by all GovToken holders. This ensures that funds cannot be spent without reaching consensus. To be able to spend from the treasury a formal proposal has to be created and voted on by token holders. If the proposal passes the vote funds will be released to the wallet address mentioned in the proposal.

## Partnership Policy

In order to further its mission, ADAO may enter into joint venture partnerships with other organizations in the Cardano network, other blockchain networks, or in the wider world.  When partnerships are established it is because each organization believes they have a shared value that can be supported through collaboration.  The terms of the partnership will be clearly defined in the Partnership Agreement.

The Partnerships Working Group and ADAO Core Contributors shall be responsible for exploring potential partnerships and negotiating partnership agreements.  For any partnership to become official it shall be presented to the ADAO membership for ratification and passed via the proposal process.  Prospective partnerships may be announced but will not have official standing until the related proposal is passed.

## Social Media and Communication Policies

The Social Media and Communication Policies of ADAO shall be determined by the Public Relations & Marketing working group and the Core Contributors.  No changes to the Designated Communication Platform, Social Media accounts, websites, or related policies will be allowed without agreement of these groups.

## Brand Standards
All brand standards, logos, templates, and identity markers of ADAO shall be determined by the Media Production working group and the Core Contributors.  No changes to these standards may occur without reasonable notice to the ADAO membership for comments and approval received from the Core Contributors.  The ADAO Foundation shall be given the sole right to defend the brand standards on behalf of the ADAO membership.  

No ADAO brand standards or trademarks may be used by any person in promotional, advertising, institutional, reference or other materials without permission of the ADAO Foundation, or the ADAO Core Contributors, except for in limited cases of fair use.  By using an ADAO brand standard or trademark, you acknowledge that ADAO is the sole owner of the mark and promise you will not interfere with ADAO’s rights in the mark, including challenging ADAO’s use, registration of, or application to register such trademark anywhere in the world, and you will not harm, infringe, or bring into disrepute any ADAO trademark.
